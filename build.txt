To Dos' shoud have {
title
description
dueDate
priority
}
include notes or a checklist

put all these to do tasks in projects, which in themselves are to dos.

keep everything in seperate modules.

Interface shoud {
    view all projects
    vie all to dos in each projects
    expand a single todo to see/edit its details
    delete a todo
}

projects are objects in an array
to add to dos to projects we need to add an array method to the project objects i think
